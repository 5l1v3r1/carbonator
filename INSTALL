1) This extension requires a Burp Suite Pro license.
2) You must initially load this file into the extension tab of Burp.
	This will perpetually keep it loaded in your burp configuration.
	This will have to be done for every new version of burp you have locally installed.
	Note: It is required that you provide the path to the Jython Jar file.
		This is installable via CentOS 6.5 by `yum install jython-2.2.1-4.8`
		The file is then located at `/usr/share/java/jython.jar`
3) This tool only runs if using the provided 'launch_burp.sh' script. 
	usage: ./launch_burp.sh scheme fqdn portnumber path
	Modify 'launch_burp.sh' to point to your burp jar locate and file name.
	This will open burp, run scan against the supplied information, generate the report, then close burp.
4) Wrap 'launch_burp.sh' into your own script to automate scanning and reporting of any number of sites.
	Example how to do this is locate within the usage information within 'launch_burp.sh'
	Ex: `cat scheme_fqdn_port.txt | xargs -L1 ./launch_burp.sh`
	scheme_fqdn_port.txt is loaded with localhost examples of how to set up a multihost flatfile.
